# 🔐 Secret Code Generator: Secret Cipher

Welcome to the **Secret Cipher Agent**, a simple yet powerful Python tool that lets you encode and decode secret messages using Caesar cipher logic. Whether you're sending secret notes or just having fun with cryptography, this tool is your undercover companion!

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🔤 **Encode Messages**: Shift letters forward by a custom number to create a secret message.
- 🔍 **Decode Messages**: Reverse the shift to reveal the original message.
- 🧠 **Smart Input Validation**: Ensures users enter valid integer shift values.
- 🧭 **Interactive Menu**: Easy-to-use command-line interface for smooth navigation.

## 🛠️ How It Works

This program uses a Caesar cipher technique:
- Letters are shifted by a specified number of positions.
- Non-letter characters (spaces, punctuation, digits) remain unchanged.
- Supports both uppercase and lowercase letters.

## 📦 Requirements

- Python 3.x  
No external libraries required — just pure Python!

## ▶️ Usage

1. **Run the program**:
   ```bash
   python secret_cipher.py
   ```

2. **Choose an option** from the menu:
   - `1` to encode a message
   - `2` to decode a message
   - `3` to exit

3. **Enter your message** and **shift value** when prompted.

## 🧠 Fun Fact

The Caesar cipher was named after Julius Caesar, who reportedly used it to protect his military communications. Now you can too — minus the Roman army.
